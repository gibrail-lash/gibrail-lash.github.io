<p> This project set out to design, manufacture, and test a composite femur bone plate as a valid substitute for current metallic fracture plates. The goal was to improve bone healing, preventing a process called "stress shielding". Stress shielding occurs when the majority of a load is transferred to the plate, resulting in a reduction in bone density once the plate is removed. This issue requires the composite plate to mimic the mechanical properties of bone to prevent this from occuring.  </p>

<p> Our composite plate would be a combination of flax, glass fibers, and epoxy resin, stacked in a sequence (configuration) that would provide the desired results. </p>
		
<p> Through a 4 month period, the team had been able to computationally obtain the optimal configuration using Matlab, simulate that configuration using SolidWorks & ANSYS, and manufacture a prototype to conduct mechanical testing, which had produced near identical results as our simulation </p>	
	
<p> Our optimal configuration had produced the most comparable stress difference between bone and plate, as well as reducing the deformation of both. </p>
