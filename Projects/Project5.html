<h2> Coming Soon </h2>
	
<p class="workInfo"> This is a very personal project that I had for a long time wanted to construct. The goal is to design a platform barrier that acts as a passageway into the trains. As of now, it is too easy for accidents to occur on track level, and this project will propose an effective method to mitigate this issue. There are already systems around the world that implement these barriers, and I feel the TTC should dole out the necessary funds to have a similar structure installed </p>
	
<p class="workInfo"> Benefits include: prevention of injury caused by falls. Reduce the current suicide rate. Reduce the wind current felt by riders as the train enters. Prevent litter build up on the track level. Improved travel times and reduction of delays caused by accidents.</p>
