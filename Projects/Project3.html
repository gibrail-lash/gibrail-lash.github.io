<p class="workInfo"> This project was created as an analysis of an in-line engine. It is simply a project to further develop my CAD skills.  </p>
	
<p class="workInfo"> SolidWorks is being used to model the engine as well as conduct a motion simulation. Below is a video clip of my progress as of today. </p>
