<h2> Coming Soon </h2>
	
<p class="workInfo"> I have always had interest in astronomy, so this is a special project for myself. 
NASA has near future plans to visit Jupiter's moon Europa for signs of life, where it contains about twice as much water as Earth has. The problem is that this ocean is contained beneath a 15-25 km ice shell.
</p>
	
<p class="workInfo">
I am looking to design a model ice drill that would accompany the lander. This drill will utilize a nuclear power source to heat water and project it out as a high-powered jet to melt its way through the ice.
